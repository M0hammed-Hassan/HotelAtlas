# HotelAtlas
Welcome to HotelAtlas, where Machine Learning meets your next vacation spot.

In this project, i’m unleashing the full power of Machine Learning magic, both Supervised and Unsupervised, plus some SQL wizardry, all to decode the mysteries hidden in a massive hotel dataset.
I guess now you know why i named it HotelAtlas as our journey needs to dive into the world of math and many different algorithms so we need an atlas.

The dataset consists of approximately 70,000 records detailing various hotel attributes such as location, amenities, pricing, and ratings.

This project includes the following key components:

- Conducting thorough Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) and data cleaning to ensure data quality and consistency.

- Applying unsupervised learning methods to segment hotels into distinct clusters based on their features and amenities.

- Building supervised learning models to predict hotel ratings effectively.

- Utilizing SQL queries for data aggregation, ranking, and enrichment to support deeper analysis.

Through HotelAtlas, the goal is to provide actionable insights into hotel characteristics and performance using rigorous machine learning and data engineering practices.
